I want to use 2FA in this app.

npm i otpauth qrcode

## Instructions for 2FA

Add a dependency for a TOTP library to your project. For a Node.js application, you can use libraries like speakeasy or otpauth.

When a user opts-in for 2FA, generate a secret key using the TOTP library. You will need to store this secret key in the database, associated with the user's account.

Generate a QR code or a manual entry code (a URL) that encodes the secret key and your application's identifier. You can use a library like qrcode to generate a QR code in a Node.js application.

The user will scan the QR code or enter the URL manually into their Google Authenticator app. The app will then use the secret key to generate TOTP codes.

When the user logs in, they will be prompted to enter the TOTP code displayed in their Google Authenticator app. Your server will verify the code using the stored secret key and the TOTP library to ensure it's correct and within the valid time window.

If the TOTP code is valid, grant access to the user.
